## Instructions to play game:

## Click "play game" in order to join in. A maximum of two connections to the server can exist, so if you try to connect more than
## once it will prevent you from joining the game. If two people are in the game and nothing appears, you will need to leave and go
## back in. Press the respective controls for the left / right player in the game. Avoid the alien lasers to not have your ship
## destroyed!
